A figure above 50 signals expansion, while anything below indicates contraction."Growth momentum is still insufficient," NBS said in a statement. - Investors eye US factory data -On forex markets the dollar extended gains ahead of the release of American factory data due later on Friday and following a steady stream of good news from the world�s biggest economy.The dollar bought 120.44 yen, compared to 119.44 yen in final 2014 trading on Wednesday.Wall Street toasted a banner year in 2014, with US equity markets finishing near all-time highs.The euro meanwhile slipped amid growing expectations that the European Central Bank, which meets on January 22, will start buying sovereign bonds.

      'HONG KONG: Asian markets tumbled Tuesday following painful losses in New York and Europe while the euro sat near nine-year lows as political uncertainty in Greece fanned renewed fears it could leave the eurozone.Oil prices, which fell below the psychological $50 a barrel mark in US trade, edged up marginally but remained under pressure owing to a global supply glut, weak demand and a stronger dollar.Tokyo tumbled 2.50 percent, Hong Kong lost 0.89 percent, Sydney eased 1.67 percent, Seoul was 1.30 percent lower while Shanghai reversed earlier losses to gain 0.70 percent.The first full week of the new year got off to a traumatic start for dealers as they bet a January 25 general election in Greece will see a victory for the the left-wing Syriza party.Markets fear the party will roll back austerity measures required under the IMF-EU bailout of the country, which could in turn lead it to exit the eurozone.The year is "barely three trading days old and already the two biggest themes that were predicted to affect the markets this year are making headlines: oversupply of commodities and the eurozone," Evan Lucas, a markets strategist in Melbourne at IG Ltd., wrote in an email to clients, according to Bloomberg News.At the weekend, Der Spiegel quoted German government sources as saying they consider Greece�s exit "almost inevitable" if Syriza wins the snap poll.Chancellor Angela Merkel and finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble had come to consider Athens� removal from the bloc would be "manageable", the magazine said.However, investors were spooked and on Monday Greek stocks sank more than 5 percent, while the Paris, Madrid and Milan exchanges fell more than 3 percent.- Oil below $50 a barrel -The Dow dived 1.86 percent, the S&P 500 fell 1.83 percent and the Nasdaq lost 1.57 percent.In currency trade the euro sank to $1.1864 Monday, its lowest level since March 2006. On Tuesday morning the single currency recovered slightly buying $1.1943.The euro was meanwhile at 142.58 yen against 142.74 yen in US trade and well down from the 144.58 yen Friday.Adding to downward pressure is increased speculation that the European Central Bank will buy eurozone government bonds to counter deflation risks.The dollar was at 119.40 yen early Tuesday, compared with 119.61 in New York Monday and also well down from 120.46 yen Friday.Oil prices were marginally up Tuesday after slipping below $50 for the first time in more than five years in New York.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for February delivery rose eight cents to $50.12 while Brent crude for February gained 14 cents to $53.25. WTI tapped $49.95 Monday.The cost of crude has plunged since June as supplies outstrip demand with key consumer China slowing down, the eurozone struggling and the dollar, in which it is priced, strengthening.A decision late last year by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to maintain output despite the glut has also cut into prices."The fundamentals of oil are unlikely to change in the first half of this year, which will see oil bedding down into its bear market for months to come," IG�s Lucas said.Gold was at $1,203.59.40 an ounce, compared with $1,196.40 on Monday.

      'NEW YORK: US oil prices Monday slipped below $50 a barrel for the first time in more than five years as the surging dollar and news of additional supplies extended a six-month rout.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for February delivery, in free fall since June, ended at $50.04 a barrel, down $2.65 or five percent. The contract got as low as $49.95 a barrel earlier in the session, its lowest level since May 1, 2009.European benchmark Brent oil for February delivery fell $3.31 to $53.11 a barrel in London.Monday�s slide in oil prices followed indications of rising output from key producers Russia and Iraq at a time when forecasters have trimmed their demand projections due to weak global economic growth.The breaching of the psychologically important $50 level also came on a turbulent day for global financial markets. US stocks fell nearly two percent, approaching the drops in European equity markets as the euro plunged to a nine-year low on revived eurozone worries.A long rally in the greenback, which gained 11 percent last year against a basket of major currencies, has weighed on the dollar-priced oil market by making crude more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies.Oil prices could fall further still, analysts say."There�s serious concern the bottom�s not in yet," said Kyle Cooper, managing partner at IAF Advisors in Houston. "Basically everyone who�s taken a stab at the bottom has been wrong.""Oil prices attempted to stabilize during the last two weeks, but the fundamentals remain weak," said Gene McGillian, broker and analyst at Tradition Energy. "The market is trying to come to a bottom. It could be anybody�s guess, but it appears we still have more to go."Fawad Razaqzada, a technical analyst at Forex.com., said the drop below $50 a barrel could trigger more selling, paving the way for oil to fall as low as $45 or $40 a barrel in the coming weeks.-Weak fundamentals-The retreat in prices comes on the heels of a multi-year boom in US oil production that has shaken the global petroleum market and put the US in a league with oil giants Russia and Saudi Arabia.Other leading producers are also pumping aggressively. Iraq�s oil ministry last week released figures showing that December crude exports reached their highest since 1980.Meanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has consistently ruled out action despite the months-long slide in prices.In November, the cartel met in Vienna and took no action, as key powerbrokers like Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali al-Naimi said he preferred for the market to balance itself. In December, Naimi told a Middle East publication the group would take the same hands-off approach even if oil fell to $20 a barrel.Meanwhile, economic growth remains uncertain in Europe and in many emerging economies, such as China and Brazil. The International Energy Agency in December projected global crude inventories could rise by nearly 300 million barrels in the first six months of 2015. The agency also cut its demand outlook by more than 200,000 barrels a day for 2015.Energy equities, by far the worst performing sector in the S&P 500 last year, suffered more pain Monday. Dow member Chevron fell 4.0 percent, while oil-services giant Schlumberger lost 2.6 percent.Key US oil companies like ConocoPhillips and shale producer Continental Resources have cut their drilling budgets for 2015.Still, analysts expect US output to continue to rise this year, owing to investments that have already been made. That will put more pressure on crude prices."I still think one of the primary drivers of the market is US oil production and I really don�t see US oil production growth slowing appreciably in the first quarter," Cooper said.

      'New York: Oil prices tumbled Tuesday to fresh 5.5-year lows as Saudi Arabia blamed weak global economic growth and said it will stick to its guns on production policy.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in February sank $2.11 to $47.93 a barrel, a low last witnessed in late April 2009.Brent North Sea crude for delivery in February dived $2.01 to $51.10 per barrel, the lowest level since early May 2009."The market is still worried that there are no signs that the supply glut will start falling," Nordea Markets analyst Thina Margrethe Saltvedt told AFP.James Williams of WTRG said the weakness in the market could take prices below $40 a barrel."Basically, there are continuing concerns about OPEC not cutting back, particularly Saudi Arabia, and US production continuing to grow," he said.Saudi Arabia�s Crown Prince Salman, in a speech on behalf of ailing King Abdullah Tuesday, said weak growth was to blame for the price fall, which has sliced deeply into the income of the world�s largest exporter."This development is not new in the oil market, and the kingdom has in the past dealt with it firmly and wisely," he said, adding that Saudi Arabia will maintain its "same approach" towards the market.That appeared to confirm Riyadh�s determination to defend its market share rather than reduce output, even if that pushes prices lower.On Monday Saudi Arabia reportedly cut its European and US export prices in order to maintain market share.

      'SYDNEY: Oil prices fell 1 percent on Wednesday after the World Bank cut its economic growth forecast, helping extend a rout that saw prices touch a nearly six-year low the previous session.Oil and other commodities came under pressure after the weaker outlook from the Washington-based financial institution reinforced worries of a gloomy economic outlook at a time when oil markets are plagued by oversupply."The global economy is running on a single engine ... the American one," World Bank chief economist Kaushik Basu said. "This does not make for a rosy outlook for the world."February Brent crude LCOc1 dropped 55 cents to $46.04 a barrel by 0927 GMT and West Texas Intermediate crude for February CLc1 was at $45.29, down 60 cents."There\'s clearly a souring of sentiment towards industrial commodities and I think that\'s spilling over to oil today," said Michael McCarthy, chief strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney."Potentially this selling is now being overdone, but today there\'s no sign of a turnaround," he said.Analysts said prices would stay under pressure as oversupply hurts both WTI and Brent, and a string of them have cut price forecasts for 2015 and 2016.Oil had tumbled nearly 5 percent on Tuesday before closing down 1.8 percent, with global benchmark Brent briefly trading at par to US prices for the first time in three months as some traders moved to take advantage of ample US storage space.US stocks are possibly approaching 80 percent of capacity by the upcoming spring season, according to US-based PIRA Energy Group.Commercial crude stockpiles in the US rose 3.9 million barrels last week, the industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) said. The Energy Information Administration\'s oil inventory report is due Wednesday at 1530 GMT.Outside the United States, some of the world\'s biggest oil traders have booked supertankers to store at least 25 million barrels at sea."Once floating storage starts, there is very little support on the downside for Brent spreads," analysts Energy Aspects said.With oil producer club OPEC deciding late last year to maintain its output despite slowing Asian and European economic growth, a glut has also appeared outside the United States."The closing gap looks to be solidifying Saudi Arabia\'s strategy to curb shale production and protect market share," ANZ bank said.',

      'London: World oil prices rebounded Friday after the International Energy Agency declared there were signs "the tide will turn" following recent multi-year lows.In early afternoon London deals, Brent North Sea crude for delivery in March rallied $1.41 to trade at $49.68 per barrel. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for February gained $1.09 at $47.34."How low the market�s floor will be is anyone�s guess," the Paris-based IEA energy watchdog said in a monthly report published on Friday."A price recovery -- barring any major disruption -- may not be imminent, but signs are mounting that the tide will turn."Crude futures have more than halved since June, crashing on stubborn worries over global oversupply and weak demand in a faltering world economy.The IEA cautioned Friday that prices were expected to keep falling in the short-term."The IEA have hedged their bets somewhat by saying the tide may turn," noted CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson.He added that the "market is very oversold and was probably due a rebound".European benchmark Brent had tumbled Tuesday to $45.19 per barrel, hitting the lowest level since March 2009.The IEA added Friday that the dramatic collapse in oil prices was still insufficient to stimulate crude consumption, because weakness in the economy has cancelled out the benefits of cheaper crude.The agency maintained its oil demand forecast for 2015, expecting it to grow by 0.9 million barrels a day to reach 93.3 million barrels.The oil market rebounded Friday after plunging the previous day on news that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had overproduced in December, while it also cut its global demand outlook.The 12-nation OPEC cartel, which produces about one third of global supplies, said in a monthly report Thursday that its production rose to 30.2 million barrels a day in December, above its 30 million limit.It also projected that demand for its oil would fall to 28.8 million barrels per day this year from 29.1 million in 2014."The yo-yo effect of the crude oil prices can be attributed to the uncertainty in the market," said Shailaja Nair, associate editorial director at energy information provider Platts, pointing to an "unstable dollar" and an "irregular equity market"."OPEC has just forecasted a drop in demand for its oil this year and this could mean that the price rally we saw this week is unlikely to last," she said.Despite the global supply glut, OPEC decided in November to maintain its collective output ceiling at 30 million barrels of oil per day.Cartel kingpin Saudi Arabia has stated that OPEC will not cut production even if the price drops to $20 per barrel, in a move aimed at hurting US shale oil producers.

While the news was able to halt oil\'s price decline, it was not enough to turn prices bullish," Morgan Stanley said on Monday in a note.China is due to report gross domestic product figures on Tuesday, which are expected to show China\'s full-year growth would undershoot Beijing\'s 7.5-percent target and would be the weakest in 24 years.In Europe, the main event of the week will be Thursday\'s meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is considered almost certain to see the launch of a government bond-buying campaign, pointing to further euro falls against the dollar as well as to downward pressure on oil prices."Commodity markets to be driven by currency markets and expectations of ECB quantitative easing this week," ANZ bank said in a note on Monday.Brent crude futures were trading at $50.12 per barrel at 0650 GMT, down 5 cents since their last settlement, although prices dipped below $50 a barrel in earlier trading. US crude was trading down 17 cents at $48.52 a barrel.Oil prices have dropped by more than half since last June as production around the world has soared while demand slows. Although the International Energy Agency (IEA) said that a reversal in trend was possible this year, it added that prices may fall further before the market begins to rise again.Analysts said that prices would likely rise away from levels below $50 per barrel, but many noted that the longer-term outlook was for oil prices to remain at lower levels than in recent years."We do not subscribe to the theory of US$20/bbl (barrel) oil. The price may go down to the US$30/bbl level for a short while, but it will bounce back," research firm Facts Global Energy (FGE) said in its January note to clients."We will be in the US$60-80/bbl price range till end of the decade," it added.',

The mainland China index has recovered almost all the losses it made on Monday in reaction to a regulatory crackdown on margin trading.Eyes are firmly on the ECB meeting later Thursday, with expectations high that it will unveil a programme of asset-purchasing, or quantitative easing (QE).Speculation has been rife for several months that more stimulus would be announced as inflation continues to weaken -- prices in the euro area fell in December for the first time in five years.According to analysts at UniCredit, the market is expecting the ECB to unveil a programme worth between 500 and 800 billion euros ($580 to $930 billion).Wall Street took its rally into a third day Wednesday, the Dow ending up 0.22 percent, the S&P 500 adding 0.47 percent and the Nasdaq 0.27 percent higher.With traders placing bets on a vast round of easing the euro has been hammered in the past few weeks, especially as it comes just a few months after the US Federal Reserve wound up its own QE programme and considers an interest rate hike this year.At one point last week the single currency fell below $1.1500 for the first time since late 2003.In afternoon trade Thursday it bought $1.1624 and 136.78 yen compared with $1.1607 and 136.85 yen in US trade."The euro decision is kind of well telegraphed but euro-dollar does have more to go on the downside," Thomas Averill, a managing director in Sydney at Rochford Capital, told Bloomberg News.

      'SINGAPORE: Saudi Arabia\'s new king is expected to continue a policy of keeping oil output steady to drive out rival producers, though the royal succession has focused market attention on the future of the kingdom\'s long-serving oil minister.King Abdullah died early on Friday and his brother Salman became king, the royal court in the world\'s top oil exporter said in a statement.Salman named his half-brother Muqrin as heir, rapidly moving to forestall any succession crisis at a moment when Saudi Arabia faces unprecedented turmoil on its borders.While the new king is not seen as likely to change Abdullah\'s policies of keeping output high to protect the OPEC cartel\'s market share, some analysts said the succession has focused attention on the future of the oil minister Ali Al-Naimi."King Abdullah was the architect of the current strategy to keep production high and force out smaller players instead of cutting," said John Kilduff, partner, Again Capital LLC in New York, adding that he expected Salman to keep production high.FGE analyst Tushar Bansal said: "By and large, as of now, no major change is expected in Saudi policies" but he said the market would focus on whether the oil minister might step down."Ali Al-Naimi has been the oil minister since 1995... It was reported that he expressed a desire to step down, but King Abdullah asked him to stay on for as long as he is around. So, the real question is, if there is a new oil minister soon, will it lead to a change in Saudi energy policy?"IHS oil consultant Victor Shum said speculation over the fate of the oil minister could add to market uncertainty though he did not expect a change of minister or in overall policy."The decision on Saudi Arabia to keep pumping (oil) was made regardless of who the king may be," said Shum.Saudi leaders were also unlikely to want to repeat some previous policy misfires.In the 1980s, Saudi Arabia cut its own output to prop up prices in the face of falling demand and rising supplies from non-OPEC suppliers but was dealt a double blow from lower prices and reduced output.Saudi policymakers would be determined not to make the same mistake again, analysts said.Crude oil futures jumped on Friday after news of the Saudi king\'s death but later came off their highs and were still trading at levels more than 50 percent below their most recent peaks in June, 2014. [O/R]"This little spike in prices is understandable... It should be sold off quickly and it won\'t last long at all," said Mark Keenan, an analyst at Societe Generale.',

      'ISLAMABAD: Pakistan\'s ongoing fuel shortage that has led to worsening power blackouts is weighing on its credit worthiness and hindering its ability to meet key reform targets laid out by the IMF, ratings agency Moody�s warned Monday. The country is currently in the grip of one of its worst power crises in years due to a shortfall in imported oil, with the situation exacerbated Sunday by an attack on a key powerline in restive Balochistan province. Moody�s said that increasing energy imports without addressing structural issues that create so-called circular debt "will further strain Pakistan\'s budget and balance of payments, a credit negative". "Fuel shortages also reflect the strained finances of state-owned distribution companies and the fuel importer, Pakistan State Oil corporation, and are a setback to the sector\'s progress on reforms made so far under Pakistan\'s financial support program with the International Monetary Fund."The IMF granted a $6.6-billion loan to Pakistan in September 2013 on the condition that it carry out extensive economic reforms, particularly in the energy and taxation sectors.Moody�s, which in July 2014 upgraded Pakistan\'s rating outlook from "negative" to "stable" in a boon for the shaky South Asian economy, said that structural reforms had been a "key driver" in its decision last year. "Circular debt" -- brought on by the dual effect of the government setting low electricity prices and customers failing to pay -- is at the heart of the crisis. State utilities lose money, and cannot pay private power generating companies, which in turn cannot pay the oil and gas suppliers, who cut off the supply. The fuel crisis began last week when Pakistan State Oil was forced to slash imports because banks refused to extend any more credit to the government-owned company, which supplies 80 percent of the country�s oil. The shortfall led to long queues of angry motorists at petrol stations, though these have since dissipated as fuel supplies have reached the pumps. But Moody�s warned that the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, which made solving the energy crisis a key campaign pledge, had so far failed to offer policy solutions and increasing oil supplies would only add to the fiscal burden. "The government�s targeted fiscal deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP in fiscal 2015 from 4.7 percent in fiscal 2014 is already impeded by delays in implementing electricity tariff adjustments and legal challenges related to tax collections," it said. Increasing fuel imports, which currently comprise 35 percent of total imports would further weigh on Pakistan�s import bill, it added.',

      'Hong Kong: The euro extended its gains against the dollar Tuesday while Asian equities climbed on hopes Greece�s new government will be able to negotiate a bailout deal with the EU and IMF that will avoid it leaving the eurozone.Regional investors took their lead from advances in Europe and New York, where news of Sunday�s Greek election win for anti-austerity party Syriza had been largely factored in, analysts said.Tokyo jumped 1.44 percent by lunch, Sydney added 0.67 percent, Shanghai edged up 0.10 percent, Seoul rose 0.46 percent and Hong Kong was flat.Markets have been buoyed by rhetoric coming out of Athens and its creditors that raises hopes they two sides can reach an agreement over Greece�s repayment of its 240-billion-euro bailout.Syriza had campaigned on renegotiating terms of the lifeline -- which included swingeing spending cuts and painful tax hikes -- and there are concerns it will default on its repayments, leading to its possible exit from the eurozone.But International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde said she was prepared to continue its financial support to the country, while some European finance ministers suggested they were willing to talk, as long as Syriza did not demand its debt be wiped out.The messages coming out of Europe helped shares higher. In Europe, equities in London, Paris and Germany all closed with healthy gains, although Athens lost more than three percent.Dow edged 0.03 percent higher, the S&P 500 added 0.26 percent and the Nasdaq put on 0.29 percent."The Greek elections had the potential to unnerve the market," Nader Naeimi, at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney, told Bloomberg News."It�s quite encouraging that the new government and the EU are willing to negotiate. The market is in a risk-on mode."The euro plunged to as low as $1.1098 at one point in Asia Monday, the lowest level since September 2003, before recovering later in the day to close out in New York at $1.1234.On Tuesday in Asia it bought $1.1250.It also sank to 131.55 yen Monday in Asia before bouncing to end the day at 133.12 yen.

      'New York: Oil prices rebounded Tuesday from six-year lows as the dollar weakened after disappointing US economic data.The US benchmark, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for March delivery, rose $1.08 (2.4 percent) to close at $45.16 a barrel.Brent North Sea crude for March settled at $49.60 a barrel in London, up $1.44 from Monday�s closing level."The market has found a bottom in the mid-40 range," said Kyle Cooper of IAF Advisors.Crude futures sank Monday to their lowest closing levels since early 2009. Crude has shed nearly 60 percent of its value in an almost uninterrupted slide since June due to a supply glut, largely boosted by robust US shale-oil production and weaker global economic growth.The greenback has been strengthening for months, making dollar-priced oil relatively more expensive, adding to the pressure on the oil market.A slight easing in the dollar Tuesday against major rival currencies such as the euro, yen and pound underpinned the buying, Cooper said."I didn�t see anything bullish today" for WTI, he said. "Equities are down, durable goods (are) not that good."New orders for long-lasting US industrial goods unexpectedly fell in December, by a steep 3.4 percent, signaling some persistent weakness in the manufacturing sector.Saudi Aramco, the world�s largest oil company in terms of crude production and exports, acknowledged that prices have fallen too far but it was up to the market, not OPEC producers, to shore them up."It�s too low for everybody," said Khalid al-Falih, the president of the state-owned energy giant, told a conference in Riyadh. "I think even consumers start to suffer in the long term."Falih also said US shale-oil production is important for the world�s long-term energy future and Saudi Aramco has earmarked an additional $7 billion for its own shale projects.The kingdom is the leading exporter and top producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which provides about a third of global oil supplies.In November, OPEC resisted calls to reduce output in the face of falling prices, keeping its output ceiling at 30 million barrels per day in a decision that exacerbated the global price slump.

      'KARACHI: State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor on Thursday urged the country�s Islamic banks to develop ways to reward their customers in line with a surge in the sector�s profitability, or face regulatory action. Islamic finance is experiencing a revival in Pakistan, aided by an ambitious five-year plan that regulators hope will double the industry�s share of the banking sector to 20 percent by 2020.A growing client base and improving asset quality helped Islamic banks post profits before tax of 12 billion rupees ($119.1 million) in the third quarter of last year, almost double the year-earlier amount, central bank data shows. But regulators want to tackle consumer perceptions that Islamic banks falter when it comes to social responsibility and ethical banking practices.The average financing-to-deposit spread - the difference between what banks charge for financing and what they pay their depositors - for all lenders, Islamic and conventional, remains high and should be "reasonably rationalised", central bank governor Ashraf Wathra said in a speech to a gathering of industry executives on Monday. He did not specify a satisfactory level, but singled out Islamic banks as the ones needing to reward customers in line with a rise in profits."Banks were advised to come up with their own solutions or the SBP will apply sharia-compliant measures to address the issue," said Wathra. He did not elaborate, but in the past the central bank has prescribed minimum targets for banks to lend to specific sectors of the economy such as agriculture and small business. Islamic banks follow religious principles which ban the charging of interest and gambling, and stress the sharing of risk and profits. The industry has developed a range of sharia-compliant financial tools, some with greater profit-sharing qualities than others. Islamic banks fall short when it comes to using strongly profit-sharing instruments such as musharaka, whose share of overall Islamic financing in Pakistan was only 10.1 percent as of September, compared to 4.2 percent a year earlier. Musharaka is a partnership in which two or more parties agree to provide capital, sharing both profits and losses according to a stipulated ratio. By contrast, murabaha - a cost-plus-profit arrangement where one party agrees to buy merchandise for another - commands the lion�s share of financing by the country�s Islamic banks, at 30.3 percent. Murabaha is often criticised for lacking economic substance and its resemblance to a conventional loan.',

It wasn't yet clear if the probe would result in a lawsuit.If the investigation is confirmed, Moody's would become the second major US credit-rating firm in the Justice Department's crosshairs, after a case against Standard & Poor's.S&P is expected to within days agree to pay $1.37 billion to settle lawsuits over its rosy grading of mortgage bonds in the financial crisis, sources told AFP.Neither Moody's nor the Justice Department were immediately reachable for comment Sunday.US authorities are probing whether the firm compromised its standards to score deals, the Journal reported, and the focus is on residential mortgage deals from about 2004 to 2007.Positive ratings on what turned out to be extremely risky mortgage deals, known as subprime loans, were a main cause of the 2008 financial collapse.Investors rely on rating firms' grades to assess risk.Numerous banks have already paid huge fines and settlements for their roles in packaging and selling the bonds as low-risk, solid investments.",

      'London: Global oil prices slid Wednesday following a three-day rally as dealers were divided on whether the commodity has bottomed out after a plunge of nearly 60 percent since June. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in March shed $1.72 to stand at $51.33 a barrel compared with Tuesday�s close.Brent North Sea crude for March slid $1.15 a barrel to trade at $56.76 in London afternoon trade.WTI had soared $3.48 Tuesday to record its highest finish since December 31, while Brent jumped $3.16 to a similar closing peak, as dealers cheered signs that the oil industry is tightening exploration activities to cap a supply glut.Ken Hasegawa, an energy trading manager at Newedge Group in Tokyo, said the crude market was "extremely volatile" after the three-day rally that began Friday saw prices surge nearly 20 percent."It has become increasingly difficult to discern the direction of the prices of crude oil, but the fundamentals remain unchanged," Hasegawa told AFP. He added that prices could "fluctuate by increasing up to $10 and falling up to $10" in the short term.Deep cuts in capital spending by major oil companies, including new announcements Tuesday by BP and BG Group, had suggested there would be tighter supplies in the future. The Baker Hughes North America rig count report for the week to January 30 showed a drop of 128 rigs to 1,937. That compared with 2,393 a year ago.Some analysts however remain doubtful that the current oil price rebound will be sustained as supplies still outweigh demand in the immediate term.The oil market has lost more than half its value since June largely owing to a surge in global reserves boosted by robust US shale oil production. The problem was exacerbated in November after OPEC decided to maintain output levels despite plunging prices.The 12-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cartel pumps about 30 percent of global crude supplies.

Pakistan also informed the IMF of its expenditure of Rs. 150 billion on the implementation of the National Action Plan (NAP) as well as repatriation of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs).Also agreed upon was Rs.60 billion in tax cuts for Pakistan, while it was decided that the target for tax cuts should reach Rs. 2750 million by June.Dar said that Pakistan�s foreign exchange reserves have increased to over $15 billion, entitling the country to receive subsidised loans.However, due to the price reduction of petrol in the country, tax revenue decreased to Rs. 68 billion. �Tax revenues were below the second-quarter indicative target by about 0.1 percent of GDP due in part to legal challenges to some revenue measures and to the fiscal effects of the plunge in international oil prices,� said a press statement from the IMF mission. �While progress has been made in addressing the structural impediments to higher and more inclusive growth, important challenges remain, such as steps to enhance the independence of the SBP, permanently resolve energy sector deficiencies, complete the legal framework for deposit insurance, and privatize or restructure public enterprises,� noted the IMF.',

      'London: Oil prices extended gains on Friday at the end of a volatile trading week, as markets awaited the release of key US jobs data.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for March delivery jumped $1.41 from Thursday�s close to $51.89 a barrel.Brent North Sea crude for March rallied $1.64 to $58.21 a barrel in London afternoon deals. WTI on Thursday jumped $2.73 in New York and Brent advanced $2.41, erasing earlier losses. "It has been a fairly volatile but robust week for the oil market," said Myrto Sokou, senior research analyst at Sucden brokers."Crude oil inventories continue to remain fairly high following ongoing large builds of crude stocks in recent weeks."All eyes were on the United States and its eagerly-awaited jobs report due Friday that is expected to show the world�s biggest economy added 235,000 jobs last month, a slowdown from December, according to analysts� forecasts.Oil prices plunged by about 60 percent from their June peaks to a six-year low last week, largely owing to a surge in global reserves boosted by robust US shale production.The problem was exacerbated in November after the OPEC cartel insisted that it would maintain output levels despite plunging prices. The 12-nation group pumps about 30 percent of global crude. (AFP)',

      "ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Water and Power issued a statement on Friday saying that the contract to supply 650MW of electricity to K-Electric cannot be renewed.The ministry went on to say that K-Electric should ensure its own production at full capacity to meet the demands.It further said that in case of an emergency shortage, at most 200 to 300MW could be provided.A summary of the decision has been sent to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.According to a K-Electric spokesperson, he warned that if the supply is stopped then there could be a possible blackout in the city as the company has no backup plan. He also said that the matter of the ministry not supplying the requirement is sub judice and could lead to contempt of court. Meanwhile, Karachi Chamber of Commerce & Industry President Iftikhar Ahmed Vohra said that if the national grid fails to provide the required demand, industrial production may be heavily affected.He demanded from the government that it should reconsider the supply of 650MW and include it in the contract.On January 26, the ministry had directed the National Power Control Centre (NPCC) not to suspend electricity supply to K-Electric following the expiry of the power distributor�s 5-year agreement for 650 MW supply on January 25. According to sources, a renewed contract with fresh conditions was under consideration earlier.",

      'London: Oil prices advanced further Monday with buying boosted by a dip in North American crude production, while a robust US jobs report also provided support, analysts said. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in March advanced $1 to $52.69 a barrel compared with Friday�s close.Brent North Sea crude for March won 63 cents to stand at $58.43 a barrel in London afternoon trade.Last week saw WTI surge seven percent and Brent add 9.4 percent, their best weekly gains since February 2011.Nicholas Teo, market analyst at CMC Markets in Singapore, said the gains were "motivated by supply-side influences" in the United States.A survey by US oil services firm Baker Hughes Inc released Friday showed the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States fell by 83 to 1,140 in the week to February 6. The dip followed a cut of 94 rigs the previous week.Bloomberg News reported that the rig count was standing at its lowest level since December 2011.The drop, coupled with announcements of deep cuts in capital spending by major oil companies including BP and BG Group, suggests tighter supplies in the future.Oil prices have plunged by about 50 percent from their June peaks, largely owing to a surge in global reserves boosted by robust US shale production.Teo said a surprisingly robust jobs report in the United States was also supporting prices as it heralds stronger demand.The Labor Department on Friday reported that the world�s biggest economy added 257,000 jobs in January and revised upward already healthy growth in the previous two months.The unemployment rate edged up to 5.7 percent from 5.6 percent, but that was in part because more people were actively seeking jobs.

      'LONDON: British bank HSBC Holdings Plc admitted on Sunday failings by its Swiss subsidiary, in response to media reports it helped wealthy customers dodge taxes and conceal millions of dollars of assets."We acknowledge and are accountable for past compliance and control failures," HSBC said on Sunday after news outlets including French newspaper Le Monde and Britain�s The Guardian published allegations about its Swiss private bank. The Guardian, along with other news outlets, cited documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) via Le Monde.HSBC said that its Swiss arm had not been fully integrated into HSBC after its purchase in 1999, allowing "significantly lower" standards of compliance and due diligence to persist.The Guardian alleged in its report that the files showed HSBC\'s Swiss bank routinely allowed clients to withdraw �bricks� of cash, often in foreign currencies which were of little use in Switzerland, marketed schemes which were likely to enable wealthy clients to avoid European taxes and colluded with some to conceal undeclared accounts from domestic tax authorities.HSBC said the Swiss private banking industry, long known for its secrecy, operated differently in the past and this may have resulted in HSBC having had "a number of clients that may not have been fully compliant with their applicable tax obligations."Its private bank, especially its Swiss arm, had undergone "a radical transformation" in recent years, it said in a detailed four-page statement.HSBC\'s Swiss private bank was largely acquired as part of its purchase of Republic National Bank of New York and Safra Republic Holdings, a US private bank.HSBC said the number of accounts in its Swiss private bank had fallen from 30,412 in 2007 to 10,343 at the end of last year and it was cooperating with authorities investigating tax matters.The data was supplied by Herve Falciani, a former IT employee of HSBC\'s Swiss private bank. HSBC said Falciani downloaded details of accounts and clients at the end of 2006 and early 2007. French authorities have obtained data on thousands of the customers and shared them with tax authorities elsewhere, including Argentina.Switzerland has charged Falciani, who Reuters was unable to reach for comment, with industrial espionage and breaching the country\'s secrecy laws. Falciani has previously told Reuters he is a whistleblower trying to help governments track down citizens who used Swiss accounts to evade tax.Some of the details of the list have been released before. The names of 2,000 Greeks with HSBC accounts was made public in 2010 and dubbed the "Lagarde List" after former French finance minister Christine Lagarde. France passed the names to Greece to help it crack down on tax evasion.',

      'Singapore: Oil prices fell in Asia on Tuesday after the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicted that global oil prices will recover only partially over the next five years, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for March delivery slipped 74 cents to $52.12, while Brent crude for March eased 77 cents to $57.57 in afternoon trade. Citing a major shakeup in the oil markets, the IEA said in its five-year forecast that prices will recover from current levels of around $50-60 per barrel but remain considerably below the more than $100 price tags reached the slump began in June."The global oil market looks set to begin a new chapter of its history, with markedly changing demand dynamics, sweeping shifts in crude trade and product supply, and dramatically different roles for OPEC and non-OPEC producers in regulating upstream supply," the IEA said.It added that it sees market rebalancing occurring "relatively swiftly", with increases in inventories halting mid-year and the market tightening."This morning�s slight dip is likely due to the IEA report that predicts only a slow recovery for oil prices. However this is only in the short term as the market fundamentals have not changed," said Shailaja Nair, associate editorial director at energy information provider Platts.Prices have plunged from their mid-2014 peaks largely owing to a surge in global reserves boosted by robust US shale production and weak global demand.

      'Singapore: Oil prices edged higher in Asia Thursday but gains were capped owing to concerns about surging stockpiles in the United States, the world�s top consumer, analysts said. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for March delivery rose 69 cents to $49.53 while Brent crude for March gained 34 cents to $55.00 in afternoon trade."There is some optimism in the market at the moment, but the fundamentals have not changed," Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, told AFP. "The increased US stockpiles adds to the worry about ample global supply, which is the main cause for the current bearish market," he added. The US Department of Energy reported on Wednesday that commercial crude reserves rose 4.9 million barrels in the week ending February 6.Stockpiles were "at the highest level for this time of year in at least the last 80 years", the agency added.Oil prices have been under pressure for months, plunging about 60 percent to just over $40 a barrel between June and the end of January.However, they have recovered slightly in recent weeks as the number of drilling rigs has fallen and oil companies have trimmed some investment.Investors are also monitoring talks on Greece�s demands to renegotiate its international bailout as the risk of a debt default looms. A meeting between Finance Minister Yaris Varoufakis and his counterparts from the eurozone late Wednesday broke up without agreement, with deliberations now set to go down to the wire next week.

      'London: World oil prices rose Friday, extending solid gains in the previous session in response to reports that leading petroleum producers are curtailing investment.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for March delivery added 75 cents to $51.96 a barrel compared with Thursday�s close.Brent North Sea crude for April leapt $1.02 to $60.30 a barrel in London afternoon trade -- the first time this year above $60.Crude futures had rallied by almost $2.50 on Thursday on reports of falling investment in the oil sector.Daniel Ang, investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore, said dealers are wary about the impact of such cuts in the immediate term. "We will continue to see range-bound trading in the immediate term with little change to fundamentals," Ang told AFP. "The main thing is crude production. As long as production levels don�t go down for now, it is hard to see a reversal of low oil prices," he said."Markets seem to be ready for prices to go up again. They are just waiting for a sign that production will be significantly cut." A US stockpiles report Wednesday showing crude reserves standing at an 80-year high for this time of the year has exacerbated concerns about a global supply glut. Oil prices have been under pressure for months, plunging about 60 percent to just over $40 a barrel between June and the end of January.However, they have recovered slightly in recent weeks as the number of drilling rigs has fallen and oil companies such as Total and Royal Dutch Shell trimmed some investment.
