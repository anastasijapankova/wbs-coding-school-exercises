// Rock, Paper, or Scissors
// Rock paper scissors is a classic two player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins.

// The possible outcomes are:

// Rock destroys scissors.
// Scissors cut paper.
// Paper covers rock.
// If there’s a tie, then the game ends in a draw.
// Our code will break the game into four parts:

// Get the user’s choice.
// Get the computer’s choice.
// Compare the two choices and determine a winner.
// Start the program and display the results.
