/**
 * Create the wishlist functionality of an eshop that is selling vitamins.
 * (only the JS part)
 * 
 * Below is given the array of products and the array of wishlisted items
 * Both arrays contain objects.
 * 
 * The products array contains objects with product id, product name, product description, price and image source
 * 
 * The wishlist array contains objects with the product id and the user name.
 * 
 * The user should be able to press a heart on the product card 
 * and the specific product should be added to a list of his favorite products.
 * 
 * If the product is already in the wishlist then it should be removed
 * 
 * 
 * Senario: each product card contains a heart. Once the heart is pressed it should change color.
 * When the colored heart is pressed, then the product should be removed from the wishlist
 * 
 * a) implement a function that adds the product id along with the user name to the wishlist array
 * if the product id for the specific user is in the wishlist then remove it
 * 
 * Senario:
 * When the user visits his favorites page, 
 * then he should able to see a list of his whishlisted products. 
 * (The list should contain all product details such as description, 
 * price, images etc)
 * b) implement a function that removes the specific product from the wishlist array
 * 
 * Senario: User wants to see his wishlisted products
 * c) implement a function that lists all the products that their ids are contained in the wishlist for the specific user
 * Output should be like:
 * 
 * For user george here is the wishlist:
 * - D3 5000 iu
 *   Takes care of your immune system
 *   Price: 10â‚¬
